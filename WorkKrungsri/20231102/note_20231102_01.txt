3: The system is reasonably compatible with existing infrastructure, offering a straightforward migration process. While some effort and planning are required, the process is manageable, and integration is typically smooth.
0: The system's compatibility with existing infrastructure is poor, leading to a challenging and error-prone migration process. Integration issues may result in significant data loss, prolonged downtime, and operational disruptions during the transition.

-------------------------------------------
Cross-platform operation: Should support at least windows and Linux.
5: The system is fully optimized for both Windows and Linux, demonstrating robust performance and uniform functionality across both platforms. Users experience seamless operation, with all features and updates consistently available regardless of the operating system.
3: The system supports both Windows and Linux, though with some variation in performance or feature sets. Most functions are available on both platforms, but users may notice slight differences in operation or update rollout.
0: The system's cross-platform support is deficient, causing considerable performance issues or a lack of critical functionality on at least one platform, leading to an inconsistent and unreliable user experience.

-------------------------------------------
Web-based platform: The system should be focused on web-based operation.
5: The system is inherently designed for web-based operation, demonstrating a robust, responsive, and intuitive web interface. It offers full functionality through a browser, ensuring platform-independent accessibility and a seamless user experience.
3: The system supports web-based operation, but it may not be fully optimized for web use. Key features are accessible through the web interface, although some functionalities might be limited or less refined compared to a native application.
0: The system's focus on web-based operation is minimal or non-existent, with a significant portion of its functionalities inaccessible or severely limited through a web interface, compelling reliance on alternative access methods.

-------------------------------------------
Browser compatible: The system should be able to view the web application from Edge and Chrome
5: The system is fully compatible with both Edge and Chrome browsers, offering a seamless and uniform experience. All features and functionalities are accessible and perform optimally on both browsers, ensuring a high level of user satisfaction.
3: The system is functional on both Edge and Chrome browsers, but users might encounter minor inconsistencies in performance or feature availability. The core functionalities are accessible, yet the experience may not be completely uniform across both browsers.
0: The system displays significant compatibility issues with Edge and/or Chrome browsers. Users face notable challenges accessing or operating the system effectively on these browsers, leading to a compromised and inefficient experience.

-------------------------------------------
Software dependencies licenses: The vendor should provide the licenses or can change to other dependencies.
5: The vendor offers a comprehensive package of software dependency licenses, ensuring full legal coverage and flexibility. Additionally, they provide the option to switch to alternative dependencies if needed, granting high adaptability and compliance with varying licensing requirements.
3: The vendor provides essential software dependency licenses, covering the majority of the system's needs. Some dependencies may not be included, and the ability to switch to alternatives is present but may involve additional effort or limited options.
0: The vendor fails to provide adequate licenses for the software dependencies, resulting in potential legal and operational risks. The option to change to other dependencies is either not supported or highly restricted, limiting adaptability and potentially incurring extra costs or legal complications.

-------------------------------------------
Deep Learning Techniques: Should support deep learning for complex pattern recognition
5: The system demonstrates advanced capabilities in deep learning, supporting sophisticated algorithms for complex pattern recognition. It is adept at handling large datasets and intricate patterns, making it highly effective in identifying nuanced fraudulent activities.
3: The system incorporates deep learning techniques, but its capabilities may be limited to less complex patterns. While it offers a certain level of efficiency in recognizing fraudulent activities, it may not be as proficient with very intricate or subtle patterns.
0: The system lacks support for deep learning techniques, significantly limiting its ability to recognize complex patterns. Its effectiveness in identifying sophisticated fraudulent activities is considerably reduced, relying on more basic or traditional methods of fraud detection.
